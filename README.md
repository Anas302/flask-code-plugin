# Flask Code Analysis PyCharm Plugin
PyCharm plugin that conducts Flask-specific code analysis in Python.
As of now, the plugin doesn the following:
 * Detects name mismatch between routes parameters and view functions arguments. (e.g. `app.route('/<userId'>`) and `def get_user(user_id):`).
 * More coming soon..

   Feel free to contribute to this project :)
